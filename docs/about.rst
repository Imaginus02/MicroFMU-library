About the MicroFMU Library
=============================================

Multiphysics simulations are essential for modern applications, particularly in embedded systems. This library enables the integration of FMUs, following the `Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard <https://fmi-standard.org/>`_, into `MicroPython-based environments <https://micropython.org/>`_, making real-time simulation feasible on resource-constrained embedded environments.

**Key Features**

* **Cross-platform support**: Compatible with Unix-based systems and ESP32 microcontrollers.
* **Lightweight execution**: Optimized for resource-constrained environments.
* **Direct FMU interaction**: Run and control FMU simulations from MicroPython.
* **Automatic FMU extraction and configuration**: Scripts automate FMU setup.
* **Modular and expandable**: Future extensions can introduce new simulation control features.
