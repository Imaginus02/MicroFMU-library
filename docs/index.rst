Welcome to the MicroFMU Library
=================================================

The MicroFMU Library enables the execution of `Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) <https://fmi-standard.org/>`_ in `MicroPython environments <https://micropython.org/>`_, making it possible to run complex simulations on embedded systems like the ESP32.

This documentation covers installation, usage, API references, and implementation details.
